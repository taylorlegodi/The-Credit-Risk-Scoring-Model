# 💳 Credit Risk Scoring Model & Decision Dashboard

As an independent project, I developed this comprehensive Credit Risk Scoring Model to simulate how financial institutions evaluate loan applications. By combining traditional statistical methods with modern interactive web tools, I created a pipeline that transforms raw applicant data into actionable credit decisions.

## 🚀 Key Achievements
* **Risk Quantification**: Built a Logistic Regression baseline to predict the probability of default, a core metric in Fintech and Banking.
* **Feature Engineering**: Implemented Weight of Evidence (WoE) and Information Value (IV) techniques to optimize categorical variables for predictive power.
* **Interactive Deployment**: Developed a live Streamlit dashboard allowing users to input applicant data and receive an instant "Approve/Reject" decision based on model logic.
* **End-to-End Pipeline**: Managed the entire lifecycle from data cleaning and exploratory analysis to model validation and deployment.

## 🛠️ Technical Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, outliers, and performed scaling on financial features like income and debt ratios.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized correlations between applicant demographics and default rates.
3. **Statistical Modeling**: Utilized Logistic Regression for its high interpretability—a requirement for regulatory compliance in credit scoring.
4. **App Deployment**: Wrapped the model in a `Streamlit` application (`app.py`) for a user-facing demonstration.
